DMS 
1) You use the AWS Schema conversion tool (AWS SCT) to extract the data locally and move it to an edge device 
2) The device automatically loads its data into an Amazon S3 bucket 
3) AWS DMS takes the files and migrates the data to the targer data store. If you are using change data capture (CDC), those updated are 
written to the amazon S3 bucket and then applied to the target data store
