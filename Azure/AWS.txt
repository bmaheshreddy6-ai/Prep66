1) IAM -  Identity access Management 

Enable to diffferent level of access 

Multifactor authentication - Two athentication menthod 

Groups, roles and User s


2) EC2 - Elastic compute cloud - resize compute capacity in the cloud 
Difference instance 

D for density - Fileservers/Data Warehousing/Hadoop 
R for RAM 
M - Main choice for general purpose apps - Application servers 
C for compute - CPU intensive app 
G - Graphics  - D3 application streaming 
I for IoPS  -NOSQL, datawarehousing 
F for FPGA  - Real time video processing, big data 
T Cheap general purpose  - Web server and small database 
P- Graphics  - machine learning 
X- Extreme Memory  - SAP HANA 

H- Map reduce , HDFS 



3) EBS- Elastic block stogare - virtual disk 

   speed access 
  General Pupose SSD 
   Provisioned IOPS SSD - Larger database 

4) Elastic block stogare volume types 
  
 Throughput optimized HDD 
 big data 
 datawarehouse 
Log processsing 
 cannot be boot volume 

Magnetic (legacy 


5) ROute 53 - buy a domin name 

Allows you to map your domain names to 

EC2 Instances 
Load Balancers 
S3 Buckets 


6) S3 - 101 

Simple storage 
highly scalable 
object based stroage 

stored in buckets 


HTTP 200 loaded succesfully 


7) servaerless 

8) Lambda - is acompute service where you can upload your code and create a lamda function 


9) API gate way - Appliction programing interface 

user -> website --> API calls -> process and fetcht he data (Lamda,EC2, S3) --> send back to API --> send to User browseer 

10) Dynamo DB - Flexible NOSQL database 

Eventually consitent - Best read performance 

Strongly consistent - All writes that received a successful response prior to the read 


11) KMS - Key management services - Encryption keys 

12) SQS - Simple queeue service - Web service that gives you access to a message queue 

user - uplaod websie--> lamda send the data to SQS --> Ec2 to poll to process it --> store in S3

13)  SQS pull base system 


14)  SES - simple email service - sending the email and receiving the emails 

automatic emails 


15) SNS  - SMS, HTTPS and SQS  - push notification 

can trigger lamda function 

16) Elastic beanstalk -  deployment s- alll at once, rolling , rolling with additional batch , 


17) RDS - Relational database 

18) Kinesis - makes it easy to load and analyze steaming data
