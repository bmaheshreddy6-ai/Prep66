KMS 

Convert plain text to Cipher Text 
Ciper Text to Plain Text 

Server side -   End location should encripted 
Cient side - Encripat in the laptop and upload to 

Symmetric  - Encryption and decryption uses same key 

Asymmetric  - Encryption uses public key and Decryption 
              uses private key 

Envelop encryption
------------------
KMS CMK --Cutomer managed KEy creates two keys 
1) Plain Text dek, 2)Encrypted dek which are part of Data Encryption keys (DEK)

2)Plain text key will be used to encrypt the 
plain text file using encription algorithm

3) Encryption dek used to combine or appedn with Encrypted file and stored in in S3 at rest 

4) delete the plain text key 

Decryption 
-----
KMS will geeerete the plain text key from the KMS and decript the data


Symmetric (AES -256)
--------------------
Single key for Encryption and Decryption 
Larger than 4 Mb then use the envelop encryption 

Asymmetric (RSA & ECC) 
---------------------

Pulic key for encryption 
Private key for Decryption 
it is used outside of ASW 
 
KMS key service types 

AWS manged keys 
Customer Managed keys (CMK)
